## Overview

The **`crack-detection-earthen-3dp`** dataset has been curated by the  
**Institute of Construction Management, Digital Engineering & Robotics in Construction (ICoM)**  
at **RWTH Aachen University**.

It focuses on **automated crack detection** in **earthen 3D-printed structures**, aiming to support research in:
- Defect identification in additive manufacturing for construction.
- Quality control and monitoring of earthen 3D-printing processes.
- Computer vision approaches for **defect detection** and an increase in overall process control and quality.

Annotated dataset for crack detection in earthen 3D printing.
